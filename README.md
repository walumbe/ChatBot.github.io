# JavaScript Chatbot 

This is a very simple "chatbot" prototype using nothing but JavaScript, HTML, & CSS. I put this in quotes because chatbots these days are way more complex - this is an exercise in vanilla JS loops and conditionals. Open it by opening the index.html file from your favourite browser.

Enjoy!
